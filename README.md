Assignment1-AST
===============

This is the first assignment for the course Arts, Science and Technology on the UvA. 
In this course we are understanding the basic concepts of code using theoretical literature of Lacan, 
Kittler and others. 
For practical skills we have combined our theoretical literature with the book of David Black 
"The well-grounded Rubyist" and practicing with tutorials such as "Learn Ruby the Hard Way".
An element of this course discusses the usage of Cucumber and Rspec in creating firstly a feature and afterwards 
executing this in steps. 

For this first assignment we had to:
Create a project (in Cucumber) that should consist of a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 features, 
each consisting of 3 to 5 scenarios.

We found our inspiration in day-to-day activities or organizational structures.
For example one of our features is based upon an adoption center called 'Jeugdzorg' in which the adoption process is 
sketched with four potential/possible scenarios. 

The four feature assignments are listed like this:
1.1Adoption -Assign adoption to fosterparents
1.2Cars -To rent a car to a customer
1.3Books -To lend a book to a customer
1.4Facebook -To reccomend new friends to a person on Facebook
